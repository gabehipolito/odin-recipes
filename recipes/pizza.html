<h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Margherita pizza history has it that this Neapolitan pie was created in 1889, when Italian chef 
        Raffaele Esposito visited Queen Margherita of Savoy in Naples and was tasked with making her a
         special dish. Esposito and his wife whipped up a pizza using basil, mozzarella and tomato 
         sauce to resemble the Italian flag. They appropriately dubbed it the “Margherita Pizza” after 
         the Queen herself.

    <p>Without sacrificing authenticity, I will show you how to make a Margherita pizza minus all the
         fuss of making traditional pizza dough.
